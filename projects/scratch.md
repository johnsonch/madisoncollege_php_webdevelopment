##Project 1
Mad libs are a simple game where you create a story template with blanks for words. 
You, or another player, then construct a list of words and place them into the 
story, creating an often silly or funny story as a result.  Create a simple 
mad-lib webpage that prompts for a noun, a verb, an adverb, and an adjective and 
injects those into a story that you create and outputs it below the input boxes

Example Output (use a different story)
```
Enter a noun: dog
Enter a verb: walk
Enter an adjective: blue
Enter an adverb: quickly

Do you walk your blue dog quickly? That's hilarious!
```

Grading Rubric
* Everthing should be contained in one self posting page


##Project 2
###BMI Calculator
You’ll often need to see if one value is within a certain range
and alter the flow of a program as a result.
Create a program to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for a person using their height in inches and weight in pounds. The program should prompt the user for weight and height.

Calculate the BMI by using the following formula:
```bmi = (weight / (height × height)) * 703```
If the BMI is between 18.5 and 25, display that the person is at a normal weight. If they are out of that range, tell them if they are underweight or overweight and tell them to consult their doctor.

Example Output
```
Your BMI is 19.5.
You are in the correct weight range.
or
Your BMI is 32.5.
You are overweight. You should see your doctor.
```
###Constraints
* Ensure your program takes only numeric data. Do not let the user continue unless the data is valid.
