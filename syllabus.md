#Responsibilities and Policies
**Student Responsibilities:** Students are expected to be familiar with Madison College policies and procedures. Many of the important policies and procedures are on the Madison College website, located at [http://madisoncollege.edu/student-rights-responsibilities](http://madisoncollege.edu/student-rights-responsibilities).

**Academic Integrity** is an expectation in all Madison College classes. Plagiarism, cheating and collusion are prohibited at Madison College. Plagiarism is defined as passing of another person's work as your own. Students who fail to observe these standards are subject to disciplinary action. Madison College has a strong policy on Academic Misconduct which is published on the Madison College website. Please refer to this page on the Madison College Website to review all Academic Integrity and Misconduct policies located at [http://madisoncollege.edu/academic-integrity](http://madisoncollege.edu/academic-integrity).

**Withdrawal Policy:** If a situation arises that prevents the successful completion of this course, please note that it is each student's responsibility to formally withdraw from this course.

Nonattendance does not constitute an official withdrawal and students will be held responsible for tuition and fees not paid. Financial aid applicants and recipients may have their refunds delayed depending upon their financial aid status.

Stop payment of a check does not constitute a formal cancellation. Registrants will be held liable for the fee until the date of official cancellation. Allow four weeks from the date of cancellation to receive a full refund of payment.

**Attendance:** You are expected to attend class. Poor attendance can lead to failure in the class. If you cannot attend a class, it is your responsibility to obtain the material missed. Lecture will not be repeated for individual students. If you withdraw from the class, please notify the instructor, and The Center for Agriscience and Technologies Office, room 173. Non-attendance will not automatically withdraw you from a course. 

**Submitting Work:** All work must be submitted as directed in the assignment instructions. 

**Backup Data:** You are expected to develop good computer use habits that minimize the impact of failure. I expect that you know to save your work frequently, after every major change, and to back up your work regularly. You should be able to backup your data to a cd or dvd. Remember failure is a matter of when ... not if.

**Student Email:** Madison College offers a student e-mail account for all students. You are responsible for monitoring your student e-mail account. Student e-mail can be accessed at: [https://mail.madisoncollege.edu/owa](https://mail.madisoncollege.edu/owa) .

Students must avoid non course related activities such as checking email or social networking sites, web surfing, or playing games because these diminish their—and their classmates'—engagement with instructional activities. Exceptions to this policy may be granted at the discretion of the instructor.

Mobile devices, (including cell phones) must be stowed in an out of sight location during quizzes and exams and are not permitted to be on the desktop, handled, nor answered during testing periods. Students who disregard this policy will receive a grade of zero for the quiz or test taken during the offense.

#Grading Policy
* All work that is to be graded must be accomplished by your own effort. 
* No points will be given for late assignments/labs/exams.
* All assignments/labs/exams must meet the [course style guide](https://github.com/johnsonchmatc/php-style-guide)
* All assignments/labs/exams must run (no errors, and must produce output). If there are compilation errors or no output, the most the assignment can receive is 50% of the points. 
* If there is output, but not all objectives are met from the assignment/lab/exam's rubric points will be removed for each item missing or incorrect.
* There is no make-up of tests or other scheduled, graded classroom activities.
* It is the responsibility of the student to make up any missed work and/or pick up any missed materials. Missing a class is NOT an excuse for failure to hand in work due.
* There is no extension of assignment due dates without prior notification of circumstance. All work that is to be graded must be accomplished by your own effort.

**Grades Posted in Blackboard:** All assignment grades are posted in Blackboard. Your instructor needs to manually grade the assignments. Sometimes this happens very quickly and sometimes it takes a week. When you've posted a quiz or lab answers, it will show up in the gradebook as a green box with a white ! in it. This means that your instructor has received your work, but has not graded it yet. Discussion boards show up in the gradebook as a green box with a white ! in it until your instructor has graded the assignment, then it will have a score in it.
